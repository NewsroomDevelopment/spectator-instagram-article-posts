# Spectator Instagram Article Posts

## How it works

A google form that can be accessed by Columbia Spectator staff populates a master spreadsheet with information about each article. This spreadsheet is then used as an external database to the React site contained in this repo. It pulls the data from the spreadsheet using the tabletop library and uses react-photo-gallery to generate the centered rows of posts. Clicking on each post will lead to the article.
